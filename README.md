# Python Activities Test Instructions

Hello, students! This guide will help you run tests for the Python activities you've been working on. Testing is a crucial part of development, helping ensure your code works as expected. Follow these instructions to run the tests for each activity.

## Getting Started

Before running any tests, make sure you've completed the activities as instructed in your assignment. Each activity should be in its own Python file in the project's root directory.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you'll need to use the terminal (Linux/macOS) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows). Here's how:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2. **Navigate to your project directory.** If your project is on your Desktop and named "python-challenges", you would type:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/python-challenges
   ```
   
3. **Change directory to the `tests/` folder:**
   ```bash
   cd tests
   ```

4. **Run a test file.** For example, to run the tests for Activity 1, type:
   ```bash
   python test_activity1.py
   ```
   Replace `test_activity1.py` with the appropriate test file name for other activities.

## Understanding Test Outputs

- Tests will provide feedback in the terminal. Look for these indicators:
  - **✔ PASSED:** Your code met the test's expectations! Great job!
  - **✘ FAILED:** Something didn't work as expected. Review the output to see what went wrong, including which inputs were used and what the expected versus actual outputs were.

## Tips for Success

- **Read test outputs carefully.** They contain valuable information on what to fix.
- **Take one test at a time.** Focus on getting one test to pass before moving on to the next.
- **Ask for help if you're stuck.** It's okay not to know everything!

## Good Luck

You're developing important skills that will serve you well in your programming journey. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to experiment and learn from each test.
