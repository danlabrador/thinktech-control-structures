# Activity 14: Collatz Conjecture Sequence Generator
#
# Task Description:
# Create a function named generate_collatz_sequence that takes an integer n as input.
# It should generate the sequence according to the Collatz conjecture rules until reaching 1.
# Return the sequence as a list, including the starting number and the final 1.
#
# Example of expected output:
# If the input is 6, the output should be [6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1].
#
# Function Template:

def generate_collatz_sequence(n):
    # Your code here
    # Generate Collatz sequence
    # Return the sequence as a list

    return []  # Placeholder return statement. Update this with your actual return statement.
